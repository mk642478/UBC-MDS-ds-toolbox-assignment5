Definition: git status
Git status displays the current status of the git repository. It allows you to easily see which
files have been saved, staged or committed vs which files have not. In order to get the same information through Jupyter Lab IDE, we would need to examine the 'Changes' field of the Git. 
It is often quicker to use the code vs IDE to check for this.
